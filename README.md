# Bible-verse-lookup
retrieve a bible verse from a server?


# Instructions
Here's the API (Application Programming Interface) we'll use: https://bible-api.com
You'll need to `import` this python package: https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/requests/using-requests-in-python

- Create a script called `verse_lookup.py`
- When you run the script from the command line using `python verse_lookup.py`:
  - Ask the user to type in a bible verse (e.g. John 3:16)
  - Find the verse from the API above
  - Print the verse to the screen
  - repeat

# Questions to ask yourself:
- How do I do something in a loop (over and over)?
- How do I get user input (using the `input` function)?
- How do I send a GET request?
- How do I parse JSON and extract the correct key?
- How do I print the result to the screen?
